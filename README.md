# Eagle ðŸ¦…
> Fly your way to the top like an eagle
### A short story 
I was scrolling through the top github user in United Kingdom [list](http://commits.top/uk.html) <br />
Then, i saw this guy [@tef](https://github.com/tef) he has 26000+ commits and he's not been active on github for some months/years (he even has commits from the **FUTURE**) ðŸ¤¯
<br />
I was so sure this was automated, i then decided to try something similar out (just for fun)
### How To
> Note: This guide require you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) installed, and also an understanding of a Command Line Interface(CLI)
- Download the `eagle.js` file from this repository
- Create an `hello.txt` file on your device
- Create a new github repository [here](https://github.com/new)
#### Clone your new repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/REPO_NAME
cd REPO_NAME # REPO_NAME is the name you choosed when creating your repo
```
- Copy the `eagle.js` and `hello.txt` file to your new repository folder
#### Start the Magic
```bash
node eagle.js
```
- Wait till you are satisfied, then press `CTR C` to stop running the command
